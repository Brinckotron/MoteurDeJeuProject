## üìñ Project Overview

What began as a first-semester game engine class project at Coll√®ge LaSalle has evolved into an ambitious action-adventure platformer roguelite. While I initially bit off more than I could chew with the scope, the project has become a testament to my persistence and growing technical skills. Despite the challenges, I continue development as this represents significant time, effort, and personal investment in my game development journey.
